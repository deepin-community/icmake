If you're installing the binary icmake package 10.03.03 from your Linux
distribution then there's a flaw in its /usr/share/icmake/icmconf file. The
flaw (not present in more recent versions) can easily be repaired:

    * in /usr/share/icmake/icmconf replace line 76:
            #define CXXFLAGS            ${CPPSTD} " -Werror -Wall -O2"
        by
            #define CXXFLAGS            "--std=c++23 -Werror -Wall -O2"
        (or use c++20 if your compiler doesn't yet support c++23)
