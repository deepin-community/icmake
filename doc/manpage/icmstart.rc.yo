manpagedescription()

The bf(icmstart.rc) file specifies files that are installed by
bf(icmstart)(1).

A default bf(icmstart.rc) is found in tt(/etc/icmake/icmstart.rc), but if 
tt($HOME/.icmake/icmstart.rc) exists then the latter file is used by
bf(icmstart)(1). tt($HOME/.icmake/icmstart.rc) in turn is overruled by
specifying a tt(-c) option when invoking bf(icmstart)(1).

The default resource file contains the following specifications, preparing for
the construction of a bf(C++) program using bf(icmbuild)(1):
        verb(
    CLASSES
    icmconf
    P main.cc 
    P main.ih 
    P usage.cc
    P version.cc
    P ? scanner 
    P ? parser  
        )
The tt(icmstart.rc) file may contain:
    itemization(
    it() empty lines, which are ignored;

    it() lines beginning with a hash-character (tt(#)), also ignored;

    it() an optional installation mode followed by a source-destination
specification. 
    )

manpagesection(INSTALLATION MODE)

    An installation mode consists of a combination of:
    itemization(
    it() either a tt(P) (don't install with tt(icmstart xxx library)) or an
        tt(L) (don't install with tt(icmstart xxx program));

    it() a tt(D), indicating that the source must also be installed by
        default, i.e., if neither `program' or `library' was specified as
        second argument;

    it() a tt(b), indicating that the file must em(not) be installed if the
        tt(-b) (basic installation) option was specified when calling
        tt(icmstart);

    it() Following the optional tt( P, L, D,) or tt(b) character a space
        delimited optional tt(?) may be specified. If specified the
        installation of the file or directory must be confirmed by the user.
    )

manpagesection(SOURCE-DESTINATION SPECIFICATIONS)

    The following source-destination specifications can be used in an
tt(icmstart.rc) file (using tt(skeletons) below to refer to tt(icmstart's)
skeleton files directory):
    itemization(
    it() tt(source)nl() 
       a file named tt(source) must exist in tt(skeletons). It is installed in
        the destination directory tt(`dest') that's specified when calling
        bf(icmstart)(1). Example: 
       verb(
    CLASSES     
        )
       tt(skeletons/CLASSES) is installed as tt(dest/CLASSES);

    it() tt(pathspec)nl()
       if `pathspec' does not begin with a slash it must exist in
        tt(skeletons).  It is installed as `pathspec' in the destination
        directory specified when calling bf(icmstart)(1). Example:
       verb(
    dir/file
        )
       tt(skeletons/file) is installed as tt(dest/dir/file);

    it() tt(/pathspec) or tt(~/pathspec)nl()
       the tt(~)-character is expanded to the user's home directory. The
        pathspec's final element is installed in the destination directory
        specified when calling bf(icmstart)(1). Example:
       verb(
    ~/.icmake/file
        )
       tt($HOME/.icmake/file) is installed as tt(dest/file)
    )

    When the above source specifications are followed by a destination
specification tt(destspec) (a file or non-absolute directory specification)
then the source specification is installed as tt(dest/destspec) below the
destination directory specified when calling bf(icmstart)(1). Examples:
        verb(
    CLASSES CLASSES             # skeletons/CLASSES is installed as 
                                #   dest/CLASSES
    dir/file dir/file           # skeletons/dir/file is installed as
                                #   dest/dir/file
    ~/.icmake/file .icmake/file # $HOME/.icmake/file is installed as 
                                #   dest/.icmake/file
        )
    Icmstart converts destination specifications to absolute paths. If these
absolute paths do not begin with tt(dest's) absolute path then an error
message is displayed and bf(icmstart) ends.

manpagefiles()
    The mentioned paths are sugestive only and may be installation dependent:
    itemization(
    it() bf(/usr/share/icmake/icmconf):
        example of an bf(icmbuild) configuration file;
    it() bf(/usr/share/icmake/CLASSES):
        example of an bf(icmbuild) tt(CLASSES) file;
    it() bf(/usr/share/icmake/icmstart.rc):
        default skeleton resource file.
